How are you feeling?\nPatient: Hi! I'm feeling pretty good today! I had a really fun day at school yesterday and I got to see my friends. We played a lot of games and ran around outside. I'm also really excited for my birthday party this weekend. I can't wait to open my presents! But sometimes I do get a little worried about my big sister. She's always been really mean to me and I don't know why. Do you think you could help me figure out how to deal with her?\nTherapist: Of course! It sounds like you have a lot going on, and it's completely normal to feel worried or upset when someone is being mean to you. Can you tell me a little bit more about what your big sister does that is mean? How does it make you feel? And have you tried talking to her about how you feel?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nPatient: Well, she always takes my toys and breaks them, and then she says it's my fault! And sometimes she hits me too. It makes me feel really sad and angry. I try to talk to her about it, but she just says I'm being a baby and to stop crying. But I don't like it when she does that! It's not fair!\nTherapist: It sounds like your big sister's behavior is really hurtful and frustrating for you. It's understandable that you feel sad and angry when she treats you that way. It's important to remember that you don't deserve to be treated meanly by anyone, especially by someone you love like your big sister. It takes a lot of courage to talk about how you feel, and it's okay if you don't know how to handle the situation right away. Let's see if we can work together to find some ways to deal with your big sister's behavior that feel safe and supportive for you. Can you tell me some things that you think might help?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nPatient: Hmm...I'm not sure. I don't want to make things worse with my sister. But I also don't want her to keep being mean to me! Can you give me some ideas?\nTherapist: Absolutely! Let's think together. Sometimes it can be helpful to set clear boundaries with someone who is treating you meanly. That means telling them what you are and aren't willing to tolerate. For example, you could tell your big sister that you don't like it when she takes your toys and breaks them, and that you would prefer it if she didn't do that anymore. It's important to be calm and confident when setting boundaries, so that the other person knows that you mean what you say. It might also be helpful to have a grown-up there to support you if you need it. Another idea is to try to find ways to avoid your big sister when she is being mean, like going to a different room or finding something else to do. It's important to take care of yourself and prioritize your own well-being, especially when someone else is being hurtful to you. Do either of those ideas\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nPatient: Yeah, I think setting boundaries might be a good idea. But I'm not sure how to do it. Can you help me practice? And what if she doesn't listen?\nTherapist: Of course! Let's start by practicing setting boundaries with someone who is not mean to you, like a stuffed animal or a doll. That way, you can get a feel for what it might be like to set boundaries with your big sister. You can tell the stuffed animal or doll that you don't like it when they do something that bothers you, and then you can set a boundary by saying \"I don't like it when you do that. Please stop.\" It's important to be firm but also kind when setting boundaries. And if the stuffed animal or doll doesn't listen, you can practice finding a grown-up to help you set the boundary. Does that sound like a good plan to you?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nPatient: Yeah, that sounds like a good plan! I'll try it out and see how it goes. But what if my big sister doesn't listen? She never listens to me!\nTherapist: It's understandable that you might be worried about your big sister not listening to you. But remember that setting boundaries is not just about getting the other person to listen to you, it's also about taking care of yourself and prioritizing your own well-being. Even if your big sister doesn't listen to you right away, you can still set boundaries and take care of yourself. And if you need help, you can always find a grown-up to support you. It's okay to take things one step at a time and see how things go. Let's try out this plan and see how it goes, and then we can always adjust it as needed. Does that sound like a good plan to you?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nPatient: Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you!\nTherapist: You're welcome! I'm here to support you, and I'm confident that you can handle this situation with courage and strength. Remember to be patient with yourself and to take things one step at a time. And don't hesitate to reach out if you need any more support or guidance. Now, let's move on to the next part of our conversation. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about or ask about?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nPatient: No, I think that's all for now. Thank you, though!\nTherapist: You're welcome! It was great talking with you today. Remember that you can always reach out to me or another trusted adult if you need any more support or guidance. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you next time!\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nPatient: Okay, thank you! Bye!\nTherapist: Hello again! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last conversation? Have there been any new challenges or successes that you'd like to talk about?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nPatient: Well, I tried to grab my toy back, but she wouldn't give it to\nTherapist: I see. It sounds like you're still having some trouble with your big sister. It's understandable that you would want to stand up for yourself and set boundaries, but it can be really hard when the other person doesn't listen. Can you tell me a little bit more about what happened when you tried to grab your toy back? What did your big sister do, and how did you feel?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nPatient: I just cried. I felt so\nTherapist: It sounds like you felt really upset and overwhelmed when your big sister wouldn't give you your toy back. It's okay to feel upset when things don't go the way we want them to, and it's important to acknowledge and validate those feelings. Can you tell me a little bit more about what you did after you cried? Did you try to talk to your big sister again, or did you do something else to take care of yourself?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nConversation saved to
