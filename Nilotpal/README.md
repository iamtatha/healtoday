1. Experimenting with Google Gemini free tier, maybe you can also experiment with it -> [https://ai.google.dev/] 
2. For now i have created an dictionary of 10 patients where each entry is an overview/metadata of that particular patient eg. name, id, age, and symptoms, and some more things will also be added as we progress.
3. Will save all the patient's metadata and conversations in txt or json file format, most probably a json file, easier to work with.
4. One more thing can someone suggest me how you guys are evaluating the generated conversations, i can't wrap my head around this. THANKS :)
