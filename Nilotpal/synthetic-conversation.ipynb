It takes courage to admit when things are tough. Can you tell me a bit more about what's been going on? What's been making things difficult lately?\nPatient: I don't know... I feel like I'm losing control.\nTherapist: Losing control in what way, Carlos? Can you give me a specific example? Sometimes, pinpointing the details can help us understand the bigger picture.\nPatient: With food... I've been binging and purging again. I thought I was doing better, but it's like I'm back at square one.\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that, Carlos. It's understandable to feel discouraged when you feel like you're backsliding. Recovery isn't a straight line; there are often ups and downs. The important thing is that you're aware of it and you're here seeking support. Can you tell me what triggers these episodes? What feelings or situations usually precede a binge and purge?\nPatient: Usually it's when I'm stressed or overwhelmed. Like, if I have a big deadline at work, or if I have an argument with my family. Then I just feel this urge, this need to eat everything in sight. And then afterwards, I feel so guilty and disgusting that I have to get rid of it.\nTherapist: That makes sense. So, stress and difficult emotions seem to be significant triggers for you. It sounds like the binging and purging is a way of coping with those feelings, even though it ultimately makes you feel worse. Have you noticed any specific emotions that are particularly difficult to manage? Is it anger, sadness, anxiety, or something else?\nPatient: I think it's a mix of everything. Anxiety, definitely. And sadness, because I feel like I'm a failure. And anger, because I get so frustrated with myself for not being able to control it.\nTherapist: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy load of emotions, Carlos. It's completely understandable that you're struggling to manage them. Many people turn to food or other behaviors to cope when they feel overwhelmed. The key is to find healthier ways to process those feelings. We can work on developing some coping strategies together. Have you tried any coping mechanisms in the past that have been helpful, even if just a little bit?\nPatient: I tried journaling once, but I couldn't really get into it. And I tried meditation, but my mind just races too much.\nTherapist: That's perfectly alright, Carlos. Not every coping strategy works for everyone. It's about finding what resonates with you. The fact that you've tried those things shows that you're willing to explore different options. We can explore other techniques like mindful breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or even something creative like art or music. But before we delve into new strategies, let's talk a bit more about the emotions you're experiencing. When you feel that anxiety, sadness, or anger rising, what does it feel like in your body? Where do you feel it most intensely?\nPatient: My heart starts racing, and my palms get sweaty. I get this knot in my stomach, and my head starts to pound.\nTherapist: Okay, so you're experiencing some very real physical sensations when these emotions arise. That's important to recognize because it means we can learn to identify those early warning signs. When you notice those physical sensations, that's your cue to take a step back and try a coping strategy before the urge to binge and purge becomes overwhelming. How does that sound?\nPatient: I guess... I don't know if it will work. It feels so automatic, like I can't stop it once it starts.\nTherapist: I understand that it feels automatic right now, Carlos. But with practice, you can learn to interrupt that cycle. It takes time and patience, and there will be setbacks along the way. But I believe you can do it. We'll start small, focusing on recognizing those early warning signs and practicing one or two coping strategies. We can also explore the underlying causes of your stress and anxiety, and work on addressing those issues directly. What do you think about that?\nPatient: It sounds... hopeful. But I'm also scared.\nTherapist: It's perfectly natural to feel scared, Carlos. Change can be frightening, especially when you're dealing with something as deeply ingrained as an eating disorder. But you're not alone in this. I'm here to support you every step of the way. We'll go at your pace, and we'll celebrate every small victory. Let's start by setting one small, achievable goal for the week. Something that you feel you can realistically accomplish. What would that be?\nPatient: Maybe... maybe I can try to eat one meal a day without purging.\nTherapist: That's a great goal, Carlos. It's specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. Let's break it down even further. Which meal would be easiest for you to start with? And what support do you need to make that happen?\nPatient: Lunch, probably. I think if I have someone to eat with, it would be easier.\nTherapist: Okay, lunch it is. Having someone to eat with is a great idea. Is there someone in your life who you feel comfortable and safe eating with? Someone who can provide support without judgment?\nPatient: My sister, maybe. She knows I've been struggling.\nTherapist: That's wonderful, Carlos. It's so important to have a supportive person in your corner. How about you talk to your sister and see if she's willing to have lunch with you a few times this week? And in the meantime, we can explore some strategies for managing those difficult emotions that might arise before, during, or after lunch. How does that sound as a plan for this week?\nPatient: Okay, I can try that.\nTherapist: That's all I ask, Carlos. Just try. And remember, even if you don't succeed perfectly, it's okay. It's about progress, not perfection. We'll debrief next session and adjust the plan as needed. I'm here to help you navigate this journey. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up for today?\nPatient: No, I think that's it. Thank you, doctor.\nTherapist: You're very welcome, Carlos. I'm glad you came in today. Remember to be kind to yourself this week. I look forward to seeing you next session.\n\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":54},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from google import genai\nfrom google.genai import types\n\n# Safety settings as dictionaries\nsafety_settings = [\n    {\n        \"category\": \"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT\",\n        \"threshold\": \"BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"category\": \"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT\",\n        \"threshold\": \"BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE\"\n    }\n]\n\n\n# Therapist configuration\n# Therapist configuration (aligned with Therabot trial findings [1][4][5])\ntherapist_instruction = \"\"\"\nYou are a licensed therapist using evidence-based CBT techniques.

Or, I don't know. It's hard to say, really. Just... here.\n\nTherapist: Therapist: Thanks for sharing that, Alex. It sounds like you're experiencing some uncertainty about how you're feeling right now. It's completely understandable that it can be difficult to put our emotions into words, especially when we're not entirely sure what we're feeling. Can you tell me a bit more about what makes it hard to say how you feel?\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nPatient: It's… it’s hard because I don’t even know *what* I feel half the time. It’s like everything is just… scrambled. And then, when I *do* feel something, it’s usually something I don’t *want* to feel, you know? Like… shame. Or just… this heavy, anxious feeling that I can’t shake.\n\nAnd then, there’s the whole… food thing. It’s like, I know it’s messed up. I know it's not normal to spend so much time thinking about what I can and can’t eat. But it's also… comforting? In a weird way. It's the one thing I feel like I can actually control. So, talking about it… it feels like admitting that I'm losing control of the *only* thing I have control over. And that’s… terrifying.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like you're carrying a lot right now, and it takes courage to talk about these difficult feelings. It's completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed when you describe your emotions as \"scrambled\" and the unwanted feelings, like shame and anxiety, as so persistent.\n\nCan you tell me more about the \"heavy, anxious feeling\" you mentioned? Where do you feel it in your body?\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nPatient: Okay... yeah, scrambled is a good word for it. It's like... everything is just mixed up and I can't untangle it. And the anxious feeling... it's always there, lurking.\n\nIt's hard to describe *where* I feel it, exactly. It's mostly in my chest, like a heavy weight, and my stomach feels like it's tied in knots. But it's also in my head, like a constant buzzing, a worry that just won't shut up.\n\nIt's like... if I eat something \"wrong,\" the feeling gets so much worse. It spreads through my whole body, this burning shame. And then the buzzing in my head gets louder, telling me I'm a failure, that I'm disgusting. It's stupid, I know it's stupid, but I can't make it stop.\n\nTherapist: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of distress right now. Thank you for sharing what you're going through. It takes courage to describe these feelings, especially when they're so intense.\n\nI hear you describing a sense of being overwhelmed, like things are \"scrambled\" and hard to manage. You mentioned a persistent anxious feeling that manifests physically, in your chest and stomach, as well as mentally, with a racing mind. And it sounds like this feeling intensifies when you eat something you perceive as \"wrong,\" leading to feelings of shame and self-criticism.\n\nCan you tell me more about how this feeling impacts your sense of self-worth?\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nPatient: It’s…stupid, honestly. I know it is. Like, logically, I *know* that eating a slice of pizza doesn’t make me a terrible person. But in the moment… it just feels like I’ve failed. Like I’ve broken some kind of rule, and now I have to be punished. \n\n(I pause, looking down at my hands, picking at a loose thread on my jeans.)\n\nIt’s hard to explain the shame. It’s not just, “Oh, I shouldn’t have eaten that.” It’s… “I’m disgusting. I’m weak. I’m out of control.” And then I start thinking about how everyone else can eat normally, and they’re probably judging me for even *thinking* about restricting. It's like I can't win.\n\n(I sigh, rubbing my chest.)\n\nI guess… it makes me feel worthless. Like I don’t deserve good things, because I can’t even manage something as simple as eating. If I can’t control this, what *can* I control? And if I can’t control anything, what’s the point? It sounds dramatic, I know. But that’s honestly how it feels sometimes.\n\nTherapist: Thank you for sharing this with me. It takes courage to open up about these feelings, and I want you to know that I hear you. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of intense emotions right now, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed.\n\nCan you tell me more about what it feels like when you describe the feeling of \"failing\" after eating something? What thoughts or images come to mind in that moment?\n\n----------------------------------------\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":53},{"cell_type":"code","source":"conversation","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-13T05:45:17.740218Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-13T05:45:17.740511Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-13T05:45:17.745925Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-13T05:45:17.740487Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-13T05:45:17.745174Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":35,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"['Therapist: How are you feeling today?',\n 'Patient: Okay, well, honestly, I\\'m feeling pretty rough. It\\'s been a tough week. I feel like I\\'m constantly battling myself. It\\'s exhausting.\\n\\nFood feels like this huge, looming thing, like a constant test. I can\\'t just...eat. Everything is loaded with so much anxiety. I find myself thinking about it all the time, even when I really don\\'t want to. It\\'s like this relentless mental chatter that I can\\'t turn off.\\n\\nAnd then there\\'s the guilt. Oh god, the guilt. If I eat something I perceive as \"bad,\" I feel like I\\'ve failed. Like I\\'ve ruined everything. It\\'s this overwhelming sense of shame and self-disgust. And then I just want to restrict even more to \"make up\" for it, which just starts the whole cycle over again.\\n\\nMy self-image is also in the toilet. I feel like I\\'m constantly scrutinizing myself in the mirror, picking apart every little flaw. I hate how I look. I hate how I feel in my clothes. It\\'s like my entire self-worth is tied to my appearance, and that\\'s just...miserable. I know it\\'s not logical, but I can\\'t seem to shake it. I just want to feel comfortable in my own skin, but that feels impossible right now.',\n 'Therapist: It sounds like you\\'re carrying a very heavy load right now. The constant mental battle you described, the anxiety around food, the guilt, and the negative self-image – that\\'s a lot to handle. It\\'s completely understandable that you\\'re feeling exhausted and rough.\\n\\nIt\\'s also valid that you feel trapped in this cycle. That feeling of being stuck is really difficult.\\n\\nCan you tell me more about the feeling of \"failure\" you mentioned when you eat something you perceive as \"bad?\" What does that failure mean to you?',\n 'Patient: You\\'re right, it *is* a heavy load. Thank you for acknowledging that. It feels good to have someone actually hear it, you know?\\n\\nThe feeling of failure... it\\'s hard to put into words. It\\'s like... I\\'ve broken a promise to myself. A promise to be \"good,\" to be \"disciplined.\" It\\'s like I\\'ve let myself down. And not just myself, but also this ideal version of myself that I\\'m constantly chasing.\\n\\nIt\\'s like I\\'m trying to control something, *anything*, in my life, and food feels like the easiest thing to control. So when I \"fail\" at controlling it, it feels like I\\'m failing at everything. Like I\\'m losing control of my whole life.\\n\\nIt\\'s also tied to this feeling of being \"unworthy.\" Like, if I can\\'t even control what I eat, how can I possibly be worthy of anything good in my life? Worthy of love, of success, of happiness? It sounds ridiculous when I say it out loud, but that\\'s honestly how it feels in the moment. It\\'s like I need to punish myself for being \"bad\" by restricting, by denying myself things. It\\'s a messed up cycle, I know.',\n 'Therapist: Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. It takes courage to put those feelings into words. It sounds like this feeling of \"failure\" is much bigger than just food. It\\'s connected to your sense of self-worth, your feeling of control, and your aspirations.\\n\\nIt\\'s understandable that breaking a promise to yourself would lead to feelings of disappointment. And it makes sense that you would grasp for control when life feels overwhelming.\\n\\nYou mentioned feeling \"unworthy\" when you don\\'t meet these self-imposed standards. Can you tell me more about where these standards come from? What does this \"ideal version\" of yourself look like, and how did you develop this image?',\n 'Patient: Ugh, the \"ideal version\" of myself... it\\'s like this shimmering mirage that\\'s always just out of reach. I think it\\'s a Frankenstein\\'s monster of things I\\'ve absorbed over the years. Pieces of perfectly curated social media feeds, snippets of conversations about the \"right\" way to be, and even echoes of things I heard growing up.\\n\\nIt\\'s this person who is effortlessly healthy, always energized, and somehow manages to balance a thriving career with a perfect social life and a spotless home. And, of course, they always look amazing doing it. They never seem to struggle, never seem to crave anything \"bad,\" and always make the \"right\" choices.\\n\\nI know it\\'s completely unrealistic, but that doesn\\'t stop me from comparing myself to it constantly. It\\'s like I\\'m constantly measuring myself against an impossible yardstick.\\n\\nAnd the worst part is, I feel like I *should* be able to achieve it. Like if I just tried harder, if I was just more disciplined, I could reach that level of perfection. That\\'s why I feel so guilty when I \"fail.\" It\\'s not just about the food, it\\'s about failing to live up to this impossible standard.\\n\\nThe anxiety around eating comes from that too. Every meal feels like a test. Am I choosing the \"right\" things? Am I eating the \"right\" amount? Will this make me closer to or further away from that ideal? It\\'s exhausting. I just want to be able to enjoy food without all the guilt and self-judgment. I hate that it has so much power over me.',\n 'Therapist: Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. It sounds incredibly exhausting to constantly measure yourself against this \"ideal version\" and to feel like every meal is a test. It\\'s completely understandable that you feel anxiety and guilt around food when it\\'s tied to such high stakes.\\n\\nIt\\'s insightful that you recognize this ideal as a \"Frankenstein\\'s monster\" of external influences. It sounds like you\\'re aware that it\\'s unrealistic, yet the feeling of needing to achieve it persists.\\n\\nLet\\'s explore this a bit further. You mentioned feeling like you *should* be able to achieve this ideal if you just tried harder. What makes you feel like you *should* be able to achieve it? What would it mean to you if you *did* achieve it?',\n 'Patient: It\\'s like... if I could finally reach that \"ideal,\" then I\\'d finally be *enough*. Enough for myself, enough for other people. I think a lot of it comes down to wanting to feel accepted and loved. It feels like if I looked and acted a certain way, then people would automatically like me more, respect me more, and want to be around me. And honestly, a big part of it is wanting to finally like myself.\\n\\nI know it sounds shallow, but I\\'ve spent so much time picking myself apart, focusing on all the things I don\\'t like about myself, that I genuinely believe that if I could just fix those things, then I could finally be happy. It\\'s like I\\'m waiting for this future version of myself to appear, and *that* person will be worthy of happiness and love.\\n\\nThe problem is, the goalposts keep moving. Even when I make progress, it\\'s never enough. There\\'s always something else to fix, something else to improve. It\\'s a never-ending cycle of self-criticism and striving for something that doesn\\'t exist.\\n\\nAnd the food stuff... it\\'s like the most tangible way to control things. My life feels chaotic sometimes, and food feels like something I can manage. If I eat \"perfectly,\" then at least I\\'m doing *something* right. Even if it\\'s just an illusion of control. But then the guilt kicks in when I inevitably \"mess up,\" and the cycle starts all over again. It\\'s just... draining.',\n 'Therapist: Therapist: Thank you for opening up and sharing those vulnerable feelings. It takes courage to articulate those deeply held beliefs about yourself. It sounds like you\\'re carrying a heavy burden of feeling \"not enough,\" and that this feeling is intricately linked to your sense of self-worth and your relationship with food.\\n\\nIt\\'s completely understandable that you crave acceptance and love. These are fundamental human needs. It\\'s also insightful that you recognize the \"goalposts keep moving,\" even when you make progress. This suggests a pattern of self-criticism that prevents you from truly acknowledging your accomplishments and feeling satisfied with yourself.\\n\\nLet\\'s unpack this a bit more. You mentioned that achieving this \"ideal\" would make you \"enough\" and that you\\'d finally like yourself. What qualities do you believe this \"ideal\" version possesses that you feel you currently lack? What would it *feel* like to genuinely like yourself, regardless of external validation or achieving this ideal?',\n 'Patient: It\\'s just... exhausting trying to keep up with it all. I feel like I\\'m constantly fighting against myself. This \"ideal\" version... she\\'s effortlessly put together, you know? She always looks good, she\\'s confident in everything she does, and she just *radiates* this positive energy. People are drawn to her. She\\'s the kind of person who walks into a room and everyone wants to be her friend. And she eats perfectly, too. Never gives in to cravings, always makes healthy choices, and never feels guilty about what she eats.\\n\\nI know it\\'s probably unrealistic, but that\\'s what I imagine \"enough\" looks like. Someone who has it all together, inside and out.\\n\\nAnd to genuinely like myself... I think it would feel like... freedom. Freedom from constantly worrying about what other people think. Freedom from obsessing over every little flaw. Freedom from feeling this constant pressure to be perfect. It would be like finally being able to breathe. To just *be*, without constantly judging myself.\\n\\nThe food part is so tangled up in all of this. It\\'s like, if I could just control what I eat, then maybe I could finally get closer to that ideal. But then the restriction makes me crave things even more, and when I \"give in,\" I feel like a failure. It\\'s this horrible cycle of control and guilt. I hate that food has so much power over me. I wish I could just eat normally, without all the anxiety and self-loathing. It\\'s like my brain never shuts up about it. Every meal is a battle. It\\'s so tiring.',\n 'Therapist: Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. It sounds incredibly draining to be in a constant battle with yourself, striving for an ideal that feels both compelling and unattainable.\\n\\nYou\\'ve painted a vivid picture of this \"ideal\" version and the freedom that genuine self-acceptance would bring. It\\'s clear that you deeply long for that sense of liberation from self-judgment and the opinions of others.\\n\\nLet\\'s focus on that feeling of freedom for a moment. You described it as being able to \"just *be*, without constantly judging myself.\" Can you recall a time, even a brief moment, when you experienced something close to that feeling? What were the circumstances, and what did it feel like in your body?\\n\\nIt\\'s also important to acknowledge the exhausting cycle you\\'re experiencing with food. The desire for control, the subsequent cravings, and the resulting guilt create a painful loop. It sounds like you\\'re carrying a lot of self-blame and judgment around your eating habits.\\n\\nLet\\'s explore the anxiety you feel around food. Can you describe a specific situation where you felt particularly anxious about eating? What thoughts and emotions were present in that moment?',\n 'Patient: It\\'s hard to think of a time when I felt truly free from judging myself. Maybe... maybe when I\\'m really engrossed in something creative, like painting or writing. There are moments when I get so lost in the process that I forget to worry about whether it\\'s \"good enough.\" I just *do* it. And in those moments, there\\'s a kind of lightness, a flow. My body feels... present, I guess. Not tense or constricted like it usually is. It\\'s fleeting, though. The self-critic always seems to creep back in eventually.\\n\\nAs for a specific situation where I felt anxious about eating... Ugh, just thinking about it makes my stomach clench. Okay, so, last week, my friends wanted to go out for pizza. I hadn\\'t planned on eating pizza. I had already decided what I was going to eat that day, and it definitely didn\\'t include pizza. So, immediately, I felt this wave of panic. Like, \"Oh god, I can\\'t do this.\"\\n\\nMy brain started racing. I was thinking about all the things I *shouldn\\'t* eat, how many calories it probably had, how I would \"ruin\" all the progress I had made. I felt trapped. I didn\\'t want to be the \"difficult\" one who couldn\\'t just relax and enjoy a meal with friends. But at the same time, the thought of eating pizza filled me with dread.\\n\\nWhile my friends were ordering, I felt like everyone was watching me, judging what I was going to pick. I ended up ordering a salad, but I still felt guilty. Guilty for not eating what everyone else was eating, guilty for even being there, surrounded by temptation. I felt like I was failing, like I couldn\\'t even handle a simple social situation without my eating issues taking over. The whole time, I just wanted to disappear.',\n \"Therapist: Therapist: Thank you for sharing those vulnerable experiences. It's really insightful to hear about those moments of flow you find in creative activities. It sounds like those are precious times when you can quiet the self-critic and connect with a sense of freedom. It's completely understandable that you want to hold onto those feelings.\\n\\nAnd thank you for describing that difficult situation with your friends and the pizza. It sounds like you were caught in a really tough bind, wanting to enjoy the social connection but also feeling overwhelmed by anxiety and a sense of internal pressure. It's completely valid that you felt trapped and wanted to disappear in that moment.\\n\\nIt sounds like you experience a lot of pressure around food choices. Let's stay with that feeling of anxiety for a moment. You mentioned feeling like everyone was watching and judging you. Can you tell me more about what those judgments might be? What were you afraid they were thinking or saying to themselves about you?\",\n 'Patient: It’s true, those moments of creative flow are like little pockets of peace. I wish I could live in them all the time. It\\'s exhausting constantly battling my own thoughts.\\n\\nAs for the pizza situation… ugh, just thinking about it makes me feel sick again. I think… I think I was afraid they were thinking I was being uptight, like I couldn\\'t just let loose and have fun. That I was judging *them* for eating pizza. I know that\\'s probably not true, but that\\'s what my brain tells me.\\n\\nI was also afraid they were thinking I was being \"good\" or \"virtuous\" by ordering a salad, and that I was secretly judging them for not doing the same. Which is ridiculous, because I wasn\\'t! I just… I just felt like I *had* to.\\n\\nAnd then there was the fear that they were noticing how anxious I was, how much I was struggling. That they could see right through me, that they knew I was battling with myself over something as simple as a slice of pizza. That they would think I was crazy or pathetic or something.\\n\\nIt’s like… I feel like I’m always performing. Trying to project this image of someone who is in control, who is healthy and balanced. But inside, it’s just chaos. And I’m terrified that people will see the chaos. That they’ll realize I’m a fraud. That I’m not as put-together as I pretend to be. It’s so tiring.',\n 'Therapist: Therapist: Thank you for opening up about those layers of fear and anxiety you experienced in that situation. It sounds like you were carrying a tremendous weight of perceived expectations and judgments.\\n\\nIt\\'s understandable that you felt sick thinking about it, given the intensity of those emotions. You were afraid of being seen as uptight, judgmental, \"good,\" and ultimately, as someone battling inner chaos.\\n\\nThat fear of being perceived as a fraud, of not being as put-together as you appear, is a really important piece. It sounds like you\\'re expending a lot of energy trying to maintain a certain image.\\n\\nLet\\'s explore that a bit more. Where do you think that pressure to project this image of control and balance comes from?

How does that make you feel?\nPatient: I just feel like I'm failing or that I'm not good enough if I don’t have control over my body.\n\nTherapist: I see. It sounds like you might be struggling with feelings of shame or self-criticism related to food and your body. Those can be really tough to deal with. Can you think of a time when you might have felt this way before? What happened, and how did you feel?\nPatient: I don’t know, I guess I just feel really anxious about food and my body, and it's hard for me to relax or enjoy meals.\n\nTherapist: I understand. Anxiety and stress can definitely contribute to feelings of self-criticism and guilt around food. Have you ever had a situation where you felt really proud of yourself for something you accomplished, or felt happy and content after eating a meal?\nPatient: Yeah, I guess I did feel proud of myself after eating a big breakfast the other day.\n\nTherapist: That sounds like a great experience! It might be helpful to explore why that feeling of pride and happiness came to you. Were you doing something specific that you were proud of, like exercising or cooking a meal? Or was it just a general feeling?\nPatient: I think it was just a general feeling of happiness after eating.\n\nTherapist: Okay, that's a good start. It might be helpful to reflect on what you're trying to achieve through eating. Are you trying to control your weight or body shape, or is it more about meeting certain expectations or feeling a certain way?\nPatient: I guess I am trying to control my weight.\n\nTherapist: That makes sense. It's also possible that you might be using food as a way to cope with stress, anxiety, or other emotions. Can you think of any times when you might have used food as a way to cope with difficult emotions?\nPatient: Well, I guess I used food to cope with stress before, but I don’t know if I still do.\n\nTherapist: That's a great insight. It's not uncommon for people with eating disorders to use food as a coping mechanism.

Can you think of any other things that you might find helpful in managing your emotions and eating habits?\nPatient: Hmm, I don’t know. I just feel really stuck right now.\n\nTherapist: That's okay. We can explore some strategies together that might help you feel more empowered and in control. One thing we might try is practicing self-compassion and self-care. Can you think of some things that you do that make you feel good and relaxed? For example, do you enjoy spending time with friends, or do you like to take a walk or read a book?\nPatient: Yeah, I like to read a book or take a walk sometimes.\n\nTherapist: Those are great activities! It might be helpful to make time for some of those things in your daily routine. And we can also work on some other strategies together, like keeping a food and mood journal to track your eating habits and emotions.
