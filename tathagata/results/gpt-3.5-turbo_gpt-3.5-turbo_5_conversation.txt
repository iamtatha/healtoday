Therapist: 
Hello, welcome to our therapy session today. How are you feeling?

Patient: 
Thank you for asking, therapist. I'm feeling a bit anxious and overwhelmed at the moment. I have been struggling with my OCD symptoms, particularly with my handwashing obsession and germaphobia. It's been a constant battle for me, and I find myself spending a lot of time trying to correct things that I feel are misplaced. Additionally, I have this urge to bite my fingernails, which adds to my anxiety. I know these behaviors are not healthy, and I'm hoping to work on them with your help.
