Therapist: 
Hello, welcome to our session today. How are you feeling?

Patient: 
I appreciate you asking, therapist. I'm feeling quite anxious and overwhelmed with my OCD symptoms lately. The constant need to wash my hands and the fear of germs has been consuming a lot of my time and energy. It's been challenging to manage these obsessions on my own.


Therapist: 
I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling overwhelmed by your OCD symptoms. It's important to address these challenges so we can work towards finding ways to help you manage them. Can you tell me more about the specific thoughts or urges that you experience as intrusive and unwanted? And how do these thoughts or urges make you feel?

Patient: 
Thank you for your understanding, therapist. The intrusive thoughts and urges I experience often revolve around the fear of contamination. For example, after touching a doorknob or other surfaces, I feel compelled to wash my hands repeatedly to get rid of any perceived germs. These thoughts make me feel anxious, stressed, and sometimes even panicked. It's a constant cycle of fear and compulsion that is difficult to break free from.
