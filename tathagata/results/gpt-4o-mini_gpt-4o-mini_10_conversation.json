It\u2019s understandable to want to find a balance, especially when those actions can become time-consuming and lead to feelings of guilt afterward.\nBreaking that cycle often involves a combination of strategies. One approach is gradually exposing yourself to the situations that trigger your anxiety without immediately resorting to compulsions. For instance, you might try delaying handwashing for a few moments after feeling the urge, allowing yourself to sit with the discomfort. This can help you build tolerance to the anxiety over time.\nAnother technique is mindfulness, which helps you acknowledge those intrusive thoughts without necessarily acting on them. Practicing deep breathing or grounding exercises can also assist in managing the physical symptoms of anxiety, like the racing heart you mentioned.\nYou\u2019ve already shown a good degree of insight into your thoughts and behaviors, which is a positive step. Recognizing that the compulsions provide only temporary relief is a powerful realization. Have you ever tried discussing these feelings or strategies with someone close to you?
