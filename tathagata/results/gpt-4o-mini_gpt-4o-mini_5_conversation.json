For instance, if I'm facing a lot of pressure at work or if there are changes in my routine, I find that my obsessions and compulsions can become even more pronounced.\nAs for strategies to cope, I have tried a few things, like setting timers for myself when I feel the urge to check or rearrange things, which sometimes helps to limit how much time I spend on those activities. I\u2019ve also practiced deep breathing exercises to help manage my anxiety when I start feeling overwhelmed.
