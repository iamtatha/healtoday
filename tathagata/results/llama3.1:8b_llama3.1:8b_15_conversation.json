This is not uncommon, but it does require attention and support.\nFirstly, I want to acknowledge that the idea of feeling \"unclean\" after waking up can be very distressing. It's possible that this feeling is related to underlying fears or anxieties that are being triggered by your thoughts about the day ahead. I'd like to gently explore these underlying emotions with you further.\nIt's also worth noting that washing your hands does provide temporary relief, but it may not address the root cause of your anxiety. This can create a cycle where you're constantly seeking immediate solutions rather than working on long-term change.\nRegarding your worry about being \"dirty\" or making mistakes, I'd like to introduce a concept called \"exposure therapy.\" This involves gradually exposing yourself to situations that trigger anxiety, while also learning coping strategies and techniques to manage those feelings. We can work together to develop a plan for gradual exposure and build up your confidence in handling these situations.\nAdditionally, we can explore other cognitive-behavioral techniques such as mindfulness, relaxation, or reframing thoughts to help you better cope with anxiety.\nLastly, I want to emphasize that this is not about \"getting rid\" of your worries completely. Rather, it's about developing the skills and strategies to manage them in a healthier way.\nWhat do you think? Is there anything specific you'd like to focus on or any particular areas where you feel overwhelmed?\n(Also, please note that if you're experiencing severe anxiety or distress, it may be helpful to consult with a mental health professional for further support.)",
