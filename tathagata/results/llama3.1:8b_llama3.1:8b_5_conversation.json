Like, if I touch something that someone else has touched before, I get this... urge to wash my hands again. Immediately. It's hard to explain, but it feels like my mind is constantly racing with worst-case scenarios about germs and contamination. *looks down at hands again, fidgeting slightly*\nI've been trying to keep track of how often I wash my hands, but it's become a bit of a habit now. I do it so many times a day... even after washing them just before. It feels like I'm stuck in this cycle. And sometimes, when I'm doing other things, like eating or watching TV, my mind starts to wander back to these thoughts about germs and contamination. *trails off, looking uncertain*\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that I feel like I've lost control of some of these habits and thoughts. They're not just little things anymore; they're affecting how I live my life. And I don't know how to stop them. *looks up at Dr. Rachel with a hint of desperation*",
